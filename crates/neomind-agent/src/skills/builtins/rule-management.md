# Rule Management

Create, update, diagnose, or delete event-driven rules over device / extension / transform metrics. Skipped discovery is the #1 cause of silent rule failures.

## When to Load This Skill

| User intent | Section to follow |
|---|---|
| "create / set up / add a rule" | Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 below |
| "why didn't rule X fire / 排查 / 没触发" | Jump to **Diagnosis Flow** |
| "delete / disable / enable rule X" | **Quick Command Reference** |
| "update an existing rule" | Run diagnosis first, then **Phase 2** with new JSON |

## HARD GATE

```
NO RULE JSON CONSTRUCTION WITHOUT PRIOR DEVICE/METRIC DISCOVERY
```

**You MUST complete Phase 1 before Phase 2.** Violating this is the single most common failure mode: rules silently never fire because the device_id or metric name was guessed.

## Phase 1: Discovery — Completion Checklist

Every item must be ticked. Re-run if any is unchecked.

- [ ] Ran `neomind device list` (or `neomind extension get <id>` for extension metrics)
- [ ] Identified the EXACT `device_id` (case-sensitive, hyphens matter) for each target
- [ ] Confirmed the EXACT metric name appears in `metric_fields` (NOT a guessed translation)
- [ ] If `metric_fields` is empty OR device offline OR >50 devices: ran `neomind device get <id>` per target
- [ ] Noted current value range (to pick a sensible threshold, not a magic number)

**Output of Phase 1** (write it down before Phase 2):
```
device_id: <string>
metric_name: <string from metric_fields>
current_value: <number from device get>
operator + threshold: <chosen based on current_value>
```

## Phase 2: Construct Rule JSON

Minimal canonical shape (only `name`, `condition.source`, `condition.operator`, `condition.threshold`, `actions` are required):

```json
{
  "name": "High Temperature Alert",
  "condition": {
    "condition_type": "comparison",
    "source": "device:living-room-sensor:temperature",
    "operator": "greater_than",
    "threshold": 30
  },
  "cooldown": 300000,
  "actions": [{"type": "notify", "message": "Temp: {value}°C", "severity": "warning"}]
}
```

### Condition Types — Pick One via Decision Tree

```
What does the user want?
├── One metric vs a number
│   → comparison  (operators: greater_than | less_than | greater_equal | less_equal | equal | not_equal)
├── One metric in a band (min..max inclusive)
│   → range        { "min": 18, "max": 28 }
├── Multiple metrics all must match
│   → logical AND  { "conditions": [...] }
├── Multiple devices, same metric, any triggers
│   → logical OR   { "conditions": [...] }
├── Negate any sub-condition
│   → logical NOT  { "conditions": [<single>] }
└── String metric (text matching)
    → string ops   (contains | starts_with | ends_with | regex), threshold is a string
```

### Source Format (3 forms only)

- `device:<device_id>:<metric>` — most common
- `extension:<ext_id>:<metric>` — needs `neomind extension get <id>` first
- `transform:<output_prefix>:<field>` — needs `neomind transform list` first

### Action Types

| Type | When to use | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `notify` | Send alert to all configured channels | `message` (supports `{value}`, `{source_id}`), `severity` (info\|warning\|critical\|emergency) |
| `execute` | Trigger a device/extension command | `target`, `target_type`, `command`, `params` |
| `trigger_agent` | Hand off to AI for complex response | `agent_id`, `input` |

### Optional Tuning Fields

- `for_duration` (ms): condition must hold this long before firing. Use 30000–60000 for noisy signals to avoid flapping. Default 0 = fire instantly.
- `cooldown` (ms): minimum gap between triggers. Default 60000. **Always set explicitly for `notify` actions** — alert storms happen without it.
- `trigger` (OPTIONAL — defaults to `data_change` when omitted, both via API and CLI): an **internally-tagged enum** (`trigger_type` is the tag, INSIDE the `trigger` object). Three shapes only:
  - Omit entirely → `{"trigger_type":"data_change"}` (sources auto-extracted from condition). This is what you want for any threshold/band/logic rule.
  - Cron schedule: `"trigger": {"trigger_type": "schedule", "cron": "0 */5 * * * *"}`
  - Manual only: `"trigger": {"trigger_type": "manual"}`
  - ❌ NEVER use: `"trigger": "data_change"` (bare string), `"trigger": {"data_change": {}}` (externally tagged), or `"trigger_type": "data_change"` (flat, at root). All three are rejected by the API. The tag field `trigger_type` MUST live INSIDE the `trigger` object.

## Phase 3: Validate — Pre-Flight Checklist

Before running `neomind rule create`, tick every box:

- [ ] `device_id` in JSON matches Phase 1 output character-for-character
- [ ] metric name in JSON matches Phase 1 output character-for-character
- [ ] operator matches metric data type (numeric vs string)
- [ ] threshold is realistic vs `current_value` from Phase 1 (not magic number)
- [ ] If action is `notify`: at least one message channel exists — run `neomind message channel-list`. If empty, load **message-management** skill first.
- [ ] If action is `execute`: target device exists in `neomind device list` and has the command listed under `command_fields`
- [ ] `cooldown` is set explicitly when `notify` is the action

## Phase 4: Activate & Verify

```bash
# Rule is ENABLED by default on creation — no separate enable step needed.
neomind rule create --json '<your_json>'
# Note the returned rule ID.

# For threshold rules: inject a test value to confirm it fires end-to-end.
neomind rule test <ID> --input '{"<metric>": <value_above_threshold>}'

# For ongoing monitoring of when/how it fires.
neomind rule history <ID>
```

## Diagnosis Flow — "Why didn't my rule fire?"

Run these in order. Stop at the first failure.

1. **Rule enabled?** `neomind rule get <ID>` → check `enabled: true`. If false: `neomind rule enable <ID>`.
2. **Device actually online?** `neomind device list` → device status. If offline, rule has no data to evaluate.
3. **Data fresh?** `neomind device get <ID>` → last metric value. If stale (older than `offline_timeout`), no recent evaluations.
4. **Condition match at least once?** `neomind rule history <ID>` → look for `evaluated: true, matched: false`. If `matched: true` but no notification → channel problem (jump to message-management).
5. **Cooldown blocking?** History shows `evaluated: true, matched: true` but `skipped: cooldown`. Raise `cooldown` only if false-positives are flooding; otherwise wait it out.
6. **`for_duration` not yet satisfied?** Condition must hold continuously for `for_duration` ms. History shows recent `matched: true` but no fire → wait longer.
7. **Source ID correct?** Verify `source` string in the rule JSON exactly matches `device:<id>:<metric>` from `device get`. Typos are silent.

## Red Flags — Stop If You See These

| Sign | Why it's wrong | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Constructing JSON before running `device list` | Guessed IDs → rule never fires | Back to Phase 1 |
| Threshold pulled from user request verbatim with no sanity check | Often wrong unit/range | Cross-check vs `current_value` |
| `notify` action but haven't run `channel-list` | Alerts vanish silently | Verify ≥1 channel, or load message-management |
| `cooldown: 0` or unset on `notify` rule | Alert storms | Set ≥300000 (5 min) |
| String operator (`contains`) on numeric metric | Always errors or never matches | Use numeric operator |
| Skipping `rule test` after creation | "Works on paper" but real flow broken | Always run with synthetic input |

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
neomind rule list                         # all rules
neomind rule get <ID>                     # inspect one
neomind rule create --json '<JSON>'       # create (enabled by default)
neomind rule update <ID> --json '<JSON>'  # modify fields
neomind rule enable <ID>                  # re-enable a paused rule
neomind rule disable <ID>                 # pause without deleting
neomind rule delete <ID>                  # permanent removal
neomind rule test <ID> --input '<JSON>'   # inject synthetic metric
neomind rule history <ID>                 # evaluation log
```

## Common Errors & Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Missing 'name' field" | JSON body missing name | Add `"name": "..."` |
| "Invalid DataSourceId" | Wrong source format | Use `device:ID:METRIC` / `extension:ID:METRIC` / `transform:PREFIX:FIELD` |
| "Device not found in condition" | Wrong device ID (guessed) | Run Phase 1 discovery |
| "Unknown metric" | Wrong metric name (guessed) | Run `device list` (check `metric_fields`) or `device get <ID>` |
| Rule not triggering | Disabled | `neomind rule enable <ID>` |
| Rule triggers too often | No cooldown / threshold too tight | Add `"cooldown": 300000` |
| Rule matches but no notification | No channels configured | Load **message-management** skill |
| Invalid JSON | Quotes/brackets/commas | Validate JSON syntax |
